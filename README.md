About the Dataset:

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

Here’s a brief summary of the 12 attributes:

1. Pclass: Passenger class (1 = 1st; 2 = 2nd; 3 = 3rd)
1. Survival: A Boolean indicating whether the passenger survived or not (0 = No; 1 = Yes); this is our target
1. Name: A field rich in information as it contains title and family names
1. Sex: male/female
1. Age: Age, a significant portion of values are missing
1. Sibsp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
1. Parch: Number of parents/children aboard
1. Ticket: Ticket number.
1. Fare: Passenger fare (British Pound).
1. Cabin: Doesthe location of the cabin influence chances of survival?
1. Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)
